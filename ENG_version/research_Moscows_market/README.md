# Moscow market research


## Task
Investors from the "Shut Up and Take My Money" fund decided to try themselves in a new area and open a catering establishment in Moscow. Customers do not yet know what kind of place it will be and what the location, menu and prices will be. A dataset with Moscow catering establishments is available, compiled on the basis of data from the Yandex Maps and Yandex Business services for the summer of 2022. It is necessary to prepare a study of the Moscow market, find interesting features and present the results obtained.

## Result
I collected and pre-processed the data, analyzed various aspects in the data (districts, types of establishments, their receipts, ratings, etc.). She gave recommendations on what to open and where to open it, and what is definitely not recommended to open.
