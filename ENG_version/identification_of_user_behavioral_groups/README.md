# Mobile application “Unnecessary things” - Identification of user groups based on behavior


## Task
There is a mobile application where people sell their unwanted items. There is data from users who performed actions in the application for the first time after October 7, 2019. It is necessary to divide users into groups (segments) according to various metrics and determine which users are the most *productive*.

## Result
I received and pre-processed the data, then performed exploratory analysis, where I created user profiles, a session log and a sales funnel. Next, I segmented users and suggested some hypotheses about users. Afterwards, I statistically tested these hypotheses and made recommendations on which steps in the application are skipped, how it is more convenient to set up data collection and which users convert better.
